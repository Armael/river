<p>The projects around the OCaml.org domain name are becoming more established
and it&#8217;s time to think about how they&#8217;re organised. 2014 saw a <em>lot</em> of
activity, which built on the <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/projects/ocamllabs/news/index.html#OnlineatOCamlorg">successes from 2013</a>.
Some of the main things that stand out to me are:</p>

<ul>  <li>More <a href="http://ocaml.org/contributors.html">volunteers</a> contributing to the public website with
translations, bug fixes and content updates, as well as many new visitors &#8212;
for example, the new page on <a href="http://ocaml.org/learn/teaching-ocaml.html">teaching OCaml</a> received over 5k
visits alone. The increasing contributions are a result of the earlier work on
<a href="http://amirchaudhry.com/announcing-new-ocamlorg/">re-engineering the site</a> and there are many ways to get involved
so please do <a href="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org/labels/contribute!">contribute</a>!</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://opam.ocaml.org/"><img src="http://amirchaudhry.com/images/web/opampkg-2015-01-08.png" style="float: right; margin-left: 10px" /></a></p>

<ul>  <li>The relentless improvements and growth of OPAM, both in terms of the
repository &#8212; with over 1000 additional packages and several
<a href="http://lists.ocaml.org/pipermail/opam-devel/2014-October/000781.html">new repo maintainers</a> &#8212; and also improved workflows (e.g the new
<a href="http://opam.ocaml.org/blog/opam-1-2-pin/">pin functionality</a>). 
The OPAM site and package list also moved to the ocaml.org domain, becoming
the substrate for the OCaml Platform efforts. This began with the work towards
<a href="http://opam.ocaml.org/blog/opam-1-2-0-beta4/">OPAM 1.2</a> and there is much more to come (including closer
integration in terms of styling). Join the <a href="http://lists.ocaml.org/listinfo/platform">Platform list</a> to
keep up to date.</li>
</ul>

<ul>  <li>Much more activity on the <a href="http://lists.ocaml.org">mailing lists</a> in general and user groups
requesting to have lists made (e.g the <a href="http://lists.ocaml.org/listinfo/teaching">teaching list</a>). If anyone
has a need for a new list, just ask on the
<a href="http://lists.ocaml.org/listinfo/infrastructure">infrastructure list</a>!</li>
</ul>

<p>There is other work besides those I&#8217;ve mentioned and I think by any measure,
all the projects have been quite successful. As the community continues to
develop, it&#8217;s important to clarify how things currently work to improve the
level of transparency and make it easier for newcomers to get involved.</p>

<h3>Factors for a governance framework</h3>

<p>For the last couple of months, I&#8217;ve been looking over how larger projects
manage themselves and the governance documents that are available. My aim has
been to put such a document together for the OCaml.org domain without
introducing burdensome processes.  There are number of things that stood out
to me during this proc&#8230;</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been learning OCaml for some time now but not really had a problem that
I wanted to solve. As such, my progress has been rather slow and sporadic
and I only make time for exercises when I&#8217;m travelling. In order to focus my
learning, I have to identify and tackle something specific. That&#8217;s usually
the best way to advance and I recently found something I can work on.</p>

<p>As I&#8217;ve been trying to write more blog posts, I want to be able to keep as
much content on my own site as possible and syndicate my posts out to other
sites I run. Put simply, I want to be able to take multiple feeds from
different sources and merge them into one feed, which will be served from
some other site. In addition, I also want to render that feed as HTML on a
webpage. All of this has to remain within the OCaml toolchain so it can be
used as part of <a href="http://openmirage.org/">Mirage</a> (i.e. I can use it when
<a href="http://amirchaudhry.com/from-jekyll-to-unikernel-in-fifty-lines">building unikernels</a>). </p>

<p>What I&#8217;m describing might sound familiar and there&#8217;s a well-known tool that
does this called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet_(software)">Planet</a>. It&#8217;s a &#8216;river of news&#8217; feed reader, which
aggregates feeds and can display posts on webpages and you can find the
<a href="http://www.planetplanet.org">original Planet</a> and it&#8217;s successor <a href="http://intertwingly.net/code/venus/docs/index.html">Venus</a>, both written in Python.
However, Venus seems to be unmaintained as there are a number of
<a href="https://github.com/rubys/venus/issues">unresolved issues and pull requests</a>, which have been
languishing for quite some time with no discussion. There does appear to be
a more active Ruby implementation called <a href="http://feedreader.github.io/">Pluto</a>, with recent commits and
no reported issues.</p>



<h3>Benefits of a Planet in pure OCaml</h3>

<p>Although I could use the one of the above options, it would be much more
useful to keep everything within the OCaml ecosystem.  This way I can make
the best use of the <a href="https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2566628">unikernel approach</a> with Mirage (i.e lean,
single-purpose appliances). Obviously, the existing options don&#8217;t lend
themselves to this approach and there are <a href="https://forge.ocamlcore.org/tracker/index.php?func=detail&amp;aid=1349&amp;group_id=1&amp;atid=101">known bugs</a> as a lot has
changed on the web since Planet Venus (e.g the adoption of HTML5).
Having said that, I can learn a lot from the existing implementati&#8230;</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve just updated my site&#8217;s HTML/CSS and moved from Twitter Bootstrap to 
<a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/learn/features.html">Zurb Foundation</a>.  This post captures my subjective notes on the 
migration.</p>

<h4>My use of Bootstrap</h4>

<p>When I originally set this site up, I didn&#8217;t know what frameworks existed or 
anything more than the basics of dealing with HTML (and barely any CSS).  I 
came across Twitter Bootstrap and immediately decided it would Solve All My 
Problems.  It really did.  Since then, I&#8217;ve gone through one &#8216;upgrade&#8217; with 
Bootstrap (from 1.x to 2.x), after which I dutifully ignored all the fixes 
and improvements (note that Bootstrap was up to v2.3.2 while I was still 
using v2.0.2).  </p>

<p><img alt="Responsive Design" src="http://amirchaudhry.com/images/switch-to-foundation/responsive-design.png" /></p>

<p>For the most part, this was fine with me but for a while now, I&#8217;ve been 
meaning to make this site &#8216;responsive&#8217; (read: not look like crap from a 
mobile).  Bootstrap v3 purports to be mobile-first so upgrading would likely 
give me what I&#8217;m after but v3 is <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/">not backwards compatible</a>, 
meaning I&#8217;d have to rewrite parts of the HTML.  Since this step was 
unavoidable, it led me to have another look at front-end frameworks, just to 
see if I was missing anything.  This was especially relevant since we&#8217;d 
<a href="http://amirchaudhry.com/announcing-new-ocamlorg/">just released</a> the new <a href="http://ocaml.org">OCaml.org</a> 
website, itself built with Bootstrap v2.3.1 (we&#8217;d done the design/templating 
work long before v3 was released).  It would be useful to know what else is 
out there for any future work.</p>

<p>Around this time I discovered Zurb Foundation and also the numerous 
comparisons between them (note: Foundation seems to come out ahead in most 
of those).  A few days ago, the folks at Zurb released 
<a href="http://zurb.com/article/1280/foundation-5-blasts-off--2">version 5</a>, so I decided that now is the time to kick the 
tires.  For the last few days, I&#8217;ve been playing with the framework and in 
the end I decided to migrate my site over completely.  </p>

<p><a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/learn/features.html"><img alt="Foundation's Yeti" src="http://amirchaudhry.com/images/switch-to-foundation/zurb-yeti.png" /></a></p>

<h4>Swapping out one framework for another</h4>

<p>Over time, I&#8217;ve become moderately experienced with HTML/CSS and I can 
usually wrangle things to look the way I want, but my solutions aren&#8217;t 
necessarily ele&#8230;</p>

<p>The DNS may still be propagating so if <a href="http://ocaml.org">http://ocaml.org</a> hasn&#8217;t updated for you then try http://166.78.252.20.  This post is in two parts: the first is the announcement and the second is a call for content.</p>

<h3>New OCaml.org website design!</h3>

<p>The new site represents a major milestone in the continuing growth of the OCaml ecosystem. It&#8217;s the culmination of a lot of volunteer work over the last several months and I&#8217;d specifically like to thank <a href="https://github.com/Chris00">Christophe</a>, <a href="http://ashishagarwal.org">Ashish</a> and <a href="http://philippewang.info/CL/">Philippe</a> for their dedication (the <a href="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org/commits/master">commit logs</a> speak volumes).  </p>

<p><a href="http://amirchaudhry.com/wireframe-demos-for-ocamlorg/"><img alt="OCaml.org Wireframes" src="http://amirchaudhry.com/images/ann-new-ocamlorg/ocaml-home-wire.png" /></a></p>

<p>We began this journey just over 8 months ago with paper, pencils and a lot of ideas. This led to a comprehensive set of <a href="http://amirchaudhry.com/wireframe-demos-for-ocamlorg/">wireframes and walk-throughs</a> of the site, which then developed into a collection of <a href="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org/wiki/Site-Redesign">Photoshop mockups</a>. In turn, these formed the basis for the html templates and style sheets, which we&#8217;ve adapted to fit our needs across the site.  </p>

<p>Alongside the design process, we also considered the kind of structure and <a href="http://lists.ocaml.org/pipermail/infrastructure/2013-July/000211.html">workflow we aspired to</a>, both as maintainers and contributors.  This led us to develop completely new tools for <a href="http://pw374.github.io/posts/2013-09-05-22-31-26-about-omd.html">Markdown</a> and <a href="http://pw374.github.io/posts/2013-10-03-20-35-12-using-mpp-two-different-ways.html">templating</a> in OCaml, which are now available in OPAM for the benefit all.  </p>

<p>Working on all these things in parallel definitely had it challenges (which I&#8217;ll write about separately) but the result has been worth the effort.  </p>

<p><a href="http://ocaml.org"><img alt="OCaml.org" src="http://amirchaudhry.com/images/ann-new-ocamlorg/ocaml-home-mockup.png" /></a></p>

<p>The journey is ongoing and we still have many more improvements we hope to make. The site you see today primarily improves upon the design, structure and workflows but in time, we also intend to incorporate more information on packages and documentation. With the new tooling, moving the website forward will become much easier and I hope that more members of the community become involved in the generation and curation of content.  This brings me to the second part of this post.</p>

<h3>Call for content</h3>

<p>We have lots of great content on the website but there are parts that could do with a refresh and gaps &#8230;</p>

<p>We&#8217;re close to releasing the new design of ocaml.org but need help from the 
OCaml community to identify and fix bugs before we switch next week.</p>

<p>Ashish, Christophe, Philippe and I have been discussing how we should go 
about this and below is the plan for migration.  If anyone would like to 
discuss any of this, then the <a href="http://lists.ocaml.org/listinfo/infrastructure">infrastructure list</a> is the best 
place to do so.</p>

<ol>  <li>    <p>We&#8217;ve made a <strong><a href="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org/tree/redesign">new branch</a></strong> on the main ocaml.org repository with 
the redesign.  This branch is a fork of the master and we&#8217;ve simply cleaned 
up and replayed our git commits there.</p>
  </li>
  <li>    <p>We&#8217;ve built a live version of the new site, which is visible at 
<strong><a href="http://preview.ocaml.org">http://preview.ocaml.org</a></strong> - this is rebuilt every few minutes 
from the branch mentioned above.  </p>
  </li>
  <li>    <p>Over the course of one week, we ask the community to review the new site 
and <strong><a href="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org/issues">report any bugs or problems</a></strong> on the issue tracker. We <em>triage</em> 
those bugs to identify any blockers and work on those first.  This is the 
phase we&#8217;ll be in from <em>today</em>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>    <p>After one week (7 days), and after blocking bugs have been fixed, we 
<strong>merge the redesign branch</strong> into the master branch.  This would 
effectively present the new site to the world.  </p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>During the above, we would not be able to accept any new pull requests on 
the master branch but would be happy to accept them on the new, redesign 
branch.  Hence, restricting the time frame to one week.  </p>

<p>Please note that the above is only intended to merge the <em>design</em> and 
<em>toolchain</em> for the new site.  Specifically, we&#8217;ve created new landing 
pages, have new style sheets and have restructured the site&#8217;s contents as 
well as made some new libraries (<a href="http://pw374.github.io/posts/2013-09-05-22-31-26-about-omd.html">OMD</a> and <a href="http://pw374.github.io/posts/2013-10-03-20-39-07-OPAMaging-MPP.html">MPP</a>). The new toolchain 
means people can write files in markdown, which makes contributing content a 
lot easier.  </p>

<p>Since the files are on GitHub, people don&#8217;t even need to clone the site 
locally to make simple edits (or even add new pages). Just click the &#8216;Edit 
this page&#8217; link in the footer to be taken to the right file in t&#8230;</p>

Last Thursday a bunch of us from the OCaml Labs team gave an OCaml tutorial 
at the <a href="http://fpdays.net/2013/sessions/index.php?session=24">FPDays</a> conference (an event for people interested in Functional 
Programming).  <a href="https://github.com/yallop">Jeremy</a> and I led the session with <a href="http://www.lpw25.net">Leo</a>, <a href="https://github.com/dsheets">David</a> and 
<a href="http://philippewang.info/CL/">Philippe</a> helping everyone progress and dealing with questions.</p>

<p><img src="http://amirchaudhry.com/images/fpdays2013/fpdays2013-01.jpg" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px" />It turned out to be by far the <em>most popular session</em> at the conference with 
over 20 people all wanting to get to grips with OCaml!  An excellent turnout 
and a great indicator of the interest that&#8217;s out there, especially when you 
offer a hands-on session to people.  This shouldn&#8217;t be a surprise as we&#8217;ve 
had good attendance for the general <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Cambridge-NonDysFunctional-Programmers/">OCaml meetups</a> I&#8217;ve run 
and also the <a href="http://ocamllabs.github.io/compiler-hacking/2013/09/17/compiler-hacking-july-2013.html">compiler hacking sessions</a>, which Jeremy and 
Leo have been building up (do sign up if you&#8217;re interested in either of 
those!).  We had a nice surprise for attendees, which were 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galley_proof">uncorrected proof</a> copies of Real World OCaml and luckily, we had just 
enough to go around.</p>

<p>For the tutorial itself, Jeremy put together a nice sequence of exercises 
and a <a href="https://github.com/ocamllabs/fpdays-skeleton">skeleton repo</a> (with helpful comments in the code) so that people 
could dive in quickly.  The event was set up to be really informal and the 
rough plan was as following:</p>

<ol>  <li>    <p><em>Installation/Intro</em> - We checked that people had been able to follow the 
<a href="http://amirchaudhry.com/fpdays-ocaml-session/">installation instructions</a>, which we&#8217;d sent them in advance. 
We also handed out copies of the book and made sure folks were comfortable 
with <a href="http://opam.ocaml.org">OPAM</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>    <p><em>Hello world</em> - A light intro to get people familiar with the OCaml 
syntax and installing packages with OPAM. This would also help people to get 
familiar with the toolchain, workflow and compilation.  </p>
  </li>
  <li>    <p><em>Monty Hall browser game</em> - Using <a href="http://ocsigen.org/js_of_ocaml/"><code>js_of_ocaml</code></a>, we wanted 
people to create and run the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem">Monty Hall problem</a> in their 
browser.  This would give people a taste of some real world interaction by 
having to deal with the DOM and interfaces.  If folks did well, they could 
add code to keep logs of the game results.</p>
  </li>
  <li>    <p><em>Client-server game</em> - The previous&#8230;</p></li></ol>

<p>On Thursday, along with <a href="https://github.com/yallop">Jeremy</a> and 
<a href="http://www.lpw25.net">Leo</a>, I&#8217;ll be running an OCaml Hands-on Session at 
the <a href="http://fpdays.net/2013/">FPDays conference</a>. Below are some prep 
instructions for attendees.</p>

<h3>Preparation for the session</h3>

<p>If you&#8217;re starting from scratch, installation can take some time so it&#8217;s 
best to get as much done in advance as possible.  You&#8217;ll need OPAM (the 
package manager), OCaml 4.01 (available through OPAM) and a few libraries 
before Thursday.  If you have any issues, please contact Amir.</p>

<ul>  <li>    <p><strong>OPAM</strong>: Follow the instructions for your platform at <a href="http://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Quick_Install.html">http://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Quick_Install.html</a>. 
OPAM requires OCaml so hopefully the relevant dependencies will kick in and 
you&#8217;ll get OCaml too (most likely version 3.12).  You can get a cup of 
coffee while you wait. After installation, run <code>opam init</code> to initialise OPAM.</p>
  </li>
  <li>    <p><strong>OCaml 4.01</strong>: We actually need the latest version of OCaml but OPAM 
makes this easy.  Just run the following (and get more coffee):</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="nv">$ </span>opam update
<span class="nv">$ </span>opam switch 4.01.0
<span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">eval</span> <span class="sb">`</span>opam config env<span class="sb">`</span></code></pre></div>

<ul>  <li><strong>Libraries</strong>: For the workshop you will need to check that you have the 
following installed: <code>libffi</code>, <code>pcre</code> and <code>pkg-config</code>.  This will depend on 
your platform so on a Mac with homebrew I would do 
<code>brew install libffi pcre pkg-config</code> or on Debian or Ubuntu 
<code>apt-get install libffi-dev</code>.  After this, two OCaml packages it&#8217;s worth 
installing in advance are <code>core</code> and <code>js_of_ocaml</code> so simply run:</li>
</ul>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="nv">$ </span>opam install core js_of_ocaml</code></pre></div>

<p>OPAM will take care of the dependencies and the rest we can get on the day!</p>

Yaron Minsky and I have been running OCaml tutorials for a few years at
<a href="http://icfpconference.org">ICFP</a> and <a href="http://cufp.org">CUFP</a>, but haven&#8217;t
really spread out into the wider conference circuit.  Now that <a href="https://realworldocaml.org">Real World
OCaml</a> is almost finished, the scene is set for
doing much more.  The first such tutorial is being help at <a href="http://fpdays.net/fpdays2013/">FPDays
2013</a> on October 24th in the lovely Murray
Edwards College in Cambridge.  Check out the <a href="http://lanyrd.com/2013/fpdays/">Lanyrd
page</a> for ticket information, and the <a href="http://lanyrd.com/2013/fpdays/sckzky/">OCaml
session</a> page for more information.</p>

<p>The basic layout of the tutorial is to get started with the guided tour of the
<a href="https://realworldocaml.org">book</a>, and then work through building a
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/yminsky/core-hello-world">distributed message broker</a>.
This gets you familiar with the <a href="https://github.com/janestreet/core">Core</a>
standard library, the <a href="https://github.com/janestreet/async">Async</a> event-driven
I/O library, and all the strongly-typed RPC plumbing that goes in between.
We&#8217;re hoping to have physical preprints of the book available for free to
attendees, so do sign up fast if you wish to attend.</p>

<p>As a bonus, the Cambridge FPDays session will feature Jeremy Yallop working through
the book and conducting the tutorial: he has an incredible depth of knowledge
about the innards of OCaml&#8217;s type system, and so advanced users will also find
a good home in this tutorial to throw questions at him too!  For those of you
interested in other programming languages, there are also excellent-looking
sessions on Erlang, F# and Scala, and Phil Wadler is giving a keynote speech.
I&#8217;m most excited about <a href="http://fpdays.net/fpdays2013/sessions/index.php?session=28">Sam Aaron&#8217;s session</a>
on live coding and music though.  You have to hear it to believe it&#8230;</p>

In my <a href="http://anil.recoil.org/2013/09/30/travis-and-ocaml.html">previous post</a>
on Travis, I explained how it can be used to easily test OCaml packages on
GitHub without having to host any infrastructure yourself.</p>

<p>The next step I wanted to investigate was how to use Travis to trigger service deployments
after a successful build.  One nice feature that Travis has is <a href="http://about.travis-ci.org/docs/user/encryption-keys/">support for
encrypted environment variables</a>. The basic workflow is that you encrypt
key/value pairs using a public key that they publish per GitHub repository.
Once registered, this is made available as a decrypted environment variable
within the Travis worker.  You can use this to transmit API keys or other
authentication data that you need to commit to the <code>travis.yml</code> file, but
obviously can&#8217;t leave on a public repository for the world to see.</p>

<p>The small hitch with this whole scheme is that there&#8217;s a very small limit
of about 90 bytes or so for the size of each individual environment variable
that&#8217;s exported, and so you can&#8217;t just stash an SSH private key in there.
Instead, it needs to be Base64 encoded, split it up into multiple environment
variables of the right size, and then reassembled within the Travis VM.  Rather
than deal with importable shell scripts between MacOS X and Linux, I created
a small <code>travis-senv</code> command-line binary to make this easier.</p>

<p>To use it, just <code>opam install travis-senv</code> and follow the instructions on the
<a href="https://github.com/avsm/travis-senv">README at the homepage</a>.  Here&#8217;s the
fragment of shell script that pushes the build output to another GitHub
repository:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh"><span class="k">if</span> <span class="o">[</span> <span class="s2">"$DEPLOY"</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">"1"</span> <span class="o">]</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="k">then</span>

I&#8217;m finalizing the installation instructions for <a href="https://realworldocaml.org">Real World OCaml</a> and
finally got around to configuring the awesome <a href="https://github.com/def-lkb/merlin">Merlin editor</a> tool.  I pretty much never configure
my editor, so here are my notes on getting Merlin working with Vim completely from scratch on
MacOS X (I&#8217;m on 10.9DP7, but this should work with earlier versions of MacOS X too).</p>

<p>First, install some basic plugin tools by following the Synastic <a href="https://github.com/scrooloose/syntastic">installation instructions</a>.</p>

<h2>Trying it out</h2>

<p>Read the excellent instructions at the <a href="https://github.com/def-lkb/merlin/wiki/vim-from-scratch">Merlin for Vim from scratch</a> wiki page.  A few immediately useful things I did are below.</p>

<p><em>Displaying types:</em> You can get the local type of something by typing in <code>\t</code> anywhere.  This is the <code><localleader></localleader></code> for anyone who has customized their setup (it is mapped to backslash by default).</p>

<p><em>Tab completing functions:</em> You can tab-complete module signatures by pressing <code>Ctrl-X-O</code> (make sure you keep Ctrl pressed the whole time).  This activates vim&#8217;s OmniComplete mode.  To get this to work with your external projects, create a <code>.merlin</code> file.  I use this for <a href="https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-dns">ocaml-dns</a> for example.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">PKG lwt cstruct
S lib
S lib_test
S lwt
B _build/lib
B _build/lib_test
B _build/lwt</code></pre></div>

<p>Also, don&#8217;t forget to pass the <code>-bin-annot</code> function to the compiler to
generate the typed-AST <code>cmt</code> files.  You can add&#8230;</p>

<p>Mort opens up with an introduction to the format of the workshop and lays out the problem space:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Visualisation and sense making:</strong> how do we make sense of such complex, technical systems, and crucially, what is the process of translating the information to</li>
<li><strong>Transparency and audit:</strong> is essential to give a feedback loop to users</li>
<li><strong>Privacy and control:&#160;</strong>...</li>
<li><strong>Analytics and commerce:</strong> there is clearly an ecosystem forming around personal data (c.f. several startups specifically around this</li>
<li><strong>Data to knowledge:</strong> what are the new business models around</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Attendee introductions</strong></p>
<p><strong>Danielle&#160;</strong>(missed her last name, is from Switzerland): did a PhD on anomaly detection and then worked at Swiss banks on security monitoring. The key challenges in the area are around the nature of the questions we need to ask about all the data that we have access to.</p>
<p><strong>Steve Brewer:</strong> coordinator of the IT as a Utility network which is funding all this. &#160;Interested in the next steps: both immediate and the overall vision and direction it's all going. &#160;Concrete actions emphasised.</p>
<p><strong>Ian Brown:</strong> Oxford University and cybersecurity. Interested broadly in these issues and also has a degree in psychology and behavioural psychology. &#160;The challenge is how to balance the "engineering" (this isnt fundamental computer science) and understand why there is so little takeup of this.</p>
<p><strong>Amir Chaudhry:</strong> working on a toolstack for the Internet of Things. &#160;When we have tweeting toasters, how do we make it all useful to people. It's not the raw data, but the insights we present back to people to make it useful.</p>
<p><strong>Elizabeth Churchill:</strong> was at Yahoo, now at eBay Research. &#160;Right now the challenge I'm facing is personalisation, and is tr&#8230;</p>

    <hr />    <div class="entry">      <div class="content">        <div>          <p><a href="http://travis-ci.org"><img src="http://anil.recoil.org/images/travis-mascot-200px.png" style="padding-left: 15px; float:right;" /></a>
A few months ago, Mike Lin posted <a href="http://blog.mlin.net/2013/02/testing-ocaml-projects-on-travis-ci.html">instructions</a> of how to bootstrap an OCaml testing environment within the <a href="http://travis-ci.org">Travis</a> continuous integration tool.  I finally got around to integrating his prototype scripts properly using the latest OCaml and OPAM versions during my travels last week to ICFP.  It&#8217;s been an extraordinarily quick and pleasant experience to add the (free!) Travis test runs to my OCaml programs on GitHub, so here&#8217;s how you can do it too.  <a href="http://dave.recoil.org">Dave Scott</a> and I have used this for about 15 of our own projects already, and I&#8217;m switching the whole of the <a href="http://openmirage.org">Mirage</a> repo infrastructure over to it this week.</p>

<p><em>(edit: I&#8217;ve done a followup post about <a href="http://anil.recoil.org/2013/10/06/travis-secure-ssh-integration.html">integrating Travis with SSH</a> to make secure deployments easier.)</em></p>

<h2>Getting started</h2>

<p>Getting my first Travis build working with one of my OCaml projects took about 2 minutes in total:</p>

<p>First, log into <a href="http://travis-ci.com">Travis</a> and sign in via Twitter.  Click on the <a href="https://travis-ci.org/profile">Accounts</a> button on the top-right and you should see a list of the all the GitHub repositories that you have access to.  Just click the <i>On</i> switch for the one you want to start testing.  Nothing will actually happen until the next code push or pull request goes to that repository.  Behind the scenes, the <i>On</i> button that you clicked use the GitHub APIs to turn on the Travis post-commit hook for your repository.</p>

<p>Create a <code>.travis.yml</code> file in your main repository (see below or <a href="https://gist.github.com/avsm/6757425">this gist</a>).  Travis doesn&#8217;t have native support for OCaml, but it isn&#8217;t really needed since we can just use <code>C</code> and write our own shell scripts.  The <code>env</code> variables define a matrix of the different combinations of OCaml and OPAM that we want to test.  Just remove variations that you don&#8217;t care about to avoid wasting Travis&#8217; CPU time (open source projects are supported on a fair-use basis by them).
Here&#8217;s the <code>.travis.yml</code> that I used for my <a href="https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-uri">ocaml-uri</a> library: </p>

<p>There is a work-in-progress site at 
<a href="http://ocaml-redesign.github.io">ocaml-redesign.github.io</a>, where we&#8217;ve 
been developing both the tools and design for the new ocaml.org pages.  This 
allows us to test our tools and fix issues before we consider merging 
changes upstream.</p>

<p>There is a more detailed post coming about all the design work to date and 
the workflow we&#8217;re using, but in the meantime, feedback on the following 
areas would be most welcome.  Please leave feedback in the form of issues on 
the <a href="https://github.com/ocamllabs/sandbox-ocaml.org/issues">ocaml.org sandbox repo</a>.  You can also raise points on the 
<a href="http://lists.ocaml.org/listinfo/infrastructure">infrastructure mailing list</a>.</p>

<ol>  <li>    <p><strong>OCaml Logo</strong> - There was some feedback on the last iteration of the 
logo, especially regarding the font, so there are now several options to 
consider.  Please look at the images on the 
<a href="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org/wiki/Draft-OCaml-Logos">ocaml.org GitHub wiki</a> and then leave your feedback on 
<a href="https://github.com/ocamllabs/sandbox-ocaml.org/issues/16">issue #16 on the sandbox repo</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>    <p><strong>Site design</strong> - Please do give feedback on the design and any glitches 
you notice. Text on each of the new landing pages is still an initial draft 
so comments and improvements there are also welcome (specifically: Home 
Page, Learn, Documentation, Platform, Community). There are already a few 
<a href="https://github.com/ocamllabs/sandbox-ocaml.org/issues">known issues</a>, so do 
add your comments to those threads first.  </p>

<h2>Accessing and using weather data in OCaml</h2>
<p>Hez Carty from MDA Information Systems on doing large-scale weather data processing.<a href="http://www.syslog.cl.cam.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/photo9-e1380049811789.jpg"><img alt="photo" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1465" src="http://www.syslog.cl.cam.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/photo9-e1380049811789-225x300.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>He started with OCaml in graduate school and was looking for something better than Python, whereas they are building systems that need to run for many years with high stability. &#160;He's not from a formal CS background but from the physical sciences, and found that the static typing made it easy to explore the language features. &#160;The native code output is also important, and he finds predictability very important in day-to-day engineering. &#160;The simple FFI also made a big difference.</p>
<p>They do weather data retrieval and use HTTP/zeromq as a message bus to do language interop, and a workflow management tool to handle dependency graphs. &#160;They take weather models frmo all these sources, and do various analyses (principal component analysis, probability models for precipitation via Monte Carlo simulations with a first order Markov chains). &#160;More generally, there is a bunch of processing for climatology and data extraction and insertion.</p>
<p>A NAM forecast plots the geo data of the USA, and overlays semitransparent layers (e.g. clouds) that are stacked up to get a fake satellite view of the earth, and then there are simulated radar returns where the model (e.g.) rains. &#160;In addition to the structured formats, there is raw streaming data from sensor stations that send back raw binary data such as precipitation events, which is written as a small OCaml library to parses them into more structured formats.</p>
<p>The big data formats are HDF4 and GRIB, which are binary data formats. There are mature C librar&#8230;</p>

<p>Marius Eriksen and Michael Sperber are co-chairing this year. Functional programming is a hot topic these days, and this&#160;year's program reflects the maturing nature of the program. Record number of submissions, and we could easily have made this a multi-day&#160;program. &#160;Videos will be available online after the event.</p>
<p>Keynote is from <a href="http://www.davethomas.net">Dave Thomas</a> on what we can learn from the "language wars of the past". &#160;His talk will cover the business, social and technical ends of building Smalltalk and his "objaholic" experiences with pushing language technology into businesses, where they never had any intention of changing in this regard. &#160;This worked over the years because it made a material difference to these businesses. &#160;Dave still uses the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K_(programming_language)">K</a> programming a lot at work.</p>

<p>Dave is responsible for the Eclipse IDE and the IBM Java virtual machines, and has delivered software on everything from mainframes to wristwatches.</p>
<p>Rush in the 70s with Symbolics and the amazingly cool hardware, followed by the rush to logic programming that led to his grants disappearing. Midway through the 80s, they discovered we wouldnt get parallelism for free with all this magic. After that came the era of machine learning and knowledge ontology crusades, but they are very specialised bits of tech. There remain sectors where ontologies are useful. Nowadays its the multicore crusades, and FP is emerging as useful.</p>
<p>Every road leads to some form of FP, because the principles underlying it apply. Dave does vector programming, Haskell does this with array transformation.</p>
<p>Dave was talking to Simon PJ outside and claimed that "FP has won!", at which point Simon replied "really?" (laughter). OO techniques can also lead to a lot of tangled code: witness the evolution of Smalltalk to the current generation of languages.</p>

    <hr />    <div class="entry">      <div class="content">        <div>          <p><a href="http://gazagnaire.org">Thomas</a> just announced the availability of the <a href="http://opam.ocamlpro.com">OPAM</a> beta release.  This has been a huge amount of work for him and <a href="http://louis.gesbert.fr/">Louis</a>, so I&#8217;m excited to see this release!  Aside from general stability, the main highlights for me are:</p>

<ul>  <li>    <p>A switch to the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/">CC0</a> public-domain-like license for the repository, and LGPL2+linking exception for OPAM itself.  The <a href="https://github.com/OCamlPro/opam-repository/issues/955">cutover to the new license</a> was the first non-gratuitous use of GitHub&#8217;s fancy issue lists I&#8217;ve seen, too!  As part of this, we&#8217;re also beginning a transition over to hosting it at <code>opam.ocaml.org</code>, to underline our committment to maintaining it as an OCaml community resource.</p>
  </li>
  <li>    <p>Much-improved support for package pinning and updates.  This is the feature that makes OPAM work well with <a href="http://openmirage.org">MirageOS</a>, since we often need to do development work on a low-level library (such as a <a href="https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-xen-block-driver">device driver</a> and recompile all the reverse dependencies.</p>
  </li>
  <li>    <p>Support for post-installation messages (e.g. to display <a href="https://github.com/OCamlPro/opam-repository/pull/1100">licensing information</a> or configuration hints) and better support for the external library management issues I explained in an earlier post about <a href="http://anil.recoil.org/2013/09/09/ocamlot-autotriaging.html">OCamlot testing</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>    <p>Better library structuring to let tools like <a href="http://github.com/OCamlPro/opam2web">Opam2web</a> work with the package metadata.  For instance, my group&#8217;s <a href="http://ocaml.io">OCaml Labs</a> has a comprehensive list of <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/projects/ocamllabs/pkg/index.html">the software packages that we work on</a> generated directly from an OPAM remote.</p>
  </li>
  <li>    <p>A growing set of administration tools (via the <code>opam-admin</code> binary) that run health checks and compute statistics over package repositories.

that I&#8217;ve been working on.  My heart leapt with joy when the copyeditor commented that she thought it was very well written,
but my joy was short-lived when it turns out that all her comments were safely ensconced as PDF comments.  A few
hundreds comments that required a response from us, too.</p>

<p><em>&#8220;No problem! MacOS X Preview can handle these!&#8221;</em> was of course my first response, but it turns out it&#8217;s totally
broken with PDF notes.  The first note that you select will appear as the content of all the other subsequent notes.
Yaron Minsky then experimented with Adobe Acrobat, which I&#8217;ve sworn never to install again after an unfortunate
incident involving the uninstaller a couple of years ago.  That turned out to be incredibly slow.  I tried a
few open-source tools such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skim_(software)">Skim</a> which, while otherwise an
excellent bit of software, couldn&#8217;t render these particular annotations.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, John Whitington just announced the release of the <a href="http://coherentpdf.com/blog/?p=68">Coherent PDF</a> command-line tools.
Since these are all written in OCaml (and have been developed over quite a few years now), he also sent in an
OPAM <a href="https://github.com/OCamlPro/opam-repository/pull/977">pull request</a> to add it to the database.
And most conveniently, this ended up solving my little PDF conundrum in less than an hour of hacking, and
has almost cured me of my lifelong fear of dealing with anything in a PDF-like format.  Here&#8217;s what I did:</p>

<ul>  <li>    <p>I installed the tools via <code>opam install cpdf</code>.  This installed the library but not the binary (<a href="https://github.com/OCamlPro/opam-repository/pull/1100">swiftly fixed</a>).</p>
  </li>
  <li>    <p>Reading the license told me that it&#8217;s for non-commercial use only, so I bought a license from the
<a href="http://coherentpdf.com">Coherent PDF</a> website (a bargain price, given how much it does!).</p>
  </li>
  <li>    <p>I ran <code>cpdf -list-annotations</code> over the PDF, and it dumped out all the comments as a text file to stdout.
This wasn&#8217;t quite enough for me, since I needed to match the annotation to a page number.  But s&#8230;</p></li></ul>

    <hr />    <div class="entry">      <div class="content">        <div>          <p>The new release of OCaml (4.01.0) was just <a href="https://sympa.inria.fr/sympa/arc/caml-list/2013-09/msg00173.html">announced</a>!
The runup to a major release like this is normally a frantic time to test that
your favourite applications don&#8217;t break unexpectedly due to some incompatible
language feature.  This release cycle has a little different though, as we&#8217;ve
been working hard on using the <a href="http://opam.ocamlpro.com">OPAM</a> package
database to build an online regression testing infrastructure to mechanize much
of this process.</p>

<p>I wanted to share some of what OCamlot does today, some of the results from
about 3 months worth of runs that may help OCaml package maintainers, and
finally where we&#8217;re going with future developments.  This work has been
done in collaboration with <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/projects/ocamllabs/people/sheets.html">David Sheets</a> (who
built the OCamlot daemon) and the OPAM team ably led by <a href="http://gazagnaire.org">Thomas Gazagnaire</a> at <a href="http://ocamlpro.com">OCamlPro</a>.
We&#8217;ve also had a lot of help from <a href="https://github.com/diml">Jeremie Dimino</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ysulsky">Yury Sulsky</a> from Jane Street
and <a href="http://dave.recoil.org">Dave Scott</a> and <a href="http://jon.recoil.org">Jon Ludlam</a> from Citrix acting as guinea pigs for their respective regular releases of the <a href="https://github.com/janestreet">Core</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/xapi-project">Xen/XAPI</a> releases to OPAM.</p>

<h2>Towards a truely portable OCaml</h2>

<p>The upstream OCaml toolchain is built on very UNIX-like principles, with a
number of command-line tools that form a build pipeline.  This process usually
ends with linking the intermediate object files with a <a href="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/tree/trunk/byterun">runtime library</a> that provides the
garbage collector and other intrinsic OS functions.</p>

<p>Given these raw compiler tools, it&#8217;s very easy to compile OCaml into all
sorts of weird and wonderful architectures.  We&#8217;ve seen it run on
<a href="http://www.algo-prog.info/ocaml_for_pic/web/index.php">8-bit PICs</a>,
several efficient Javascript backends (originally <a href="http://jaked.github.io/ocamljs/">ocamljs</a> and more recently <a href="http://ocsigen.org/js_of_ocaml">js_of_ocaml</a>),
and of course my own <a href="http://openmirage.org">Mirage</a> Xen unikernel.</p>

<p>While the compiler tools themselves are quite portable and work on almost any
UNIX-like system, the build system scaffolding around third-party packages is
less portable.  Some features such as C bindings often contribute to build
breakage on some less-used operating systems such as FreeBSD or OpenBSD, as
they usually require probing for header file locations&#8230;</p>

    <hr />    <div class="entry">      <div class="content">        <div>          <p>The second and final public beta of Real World OCaml is now available:
  <a href="https://realworldocaml.org">https://realworldocaml.org</a></p>

<p>Release notes:</p>

<ul>  <li>    <p>Over 2,000 comments from proofreaders have been resolved.  We realize that
reading early content is hard work, and hugely appreciate the spirited
feedback!  The book is now a week away from being handed over to the
O&#8217;Reilly production team for copyediting, so the window for changes are
limited after that.  Comments reset between milestones and so beta2 is a
clean slate; we&#8217;re still working through some remaining older issues.</p>
  </li>
  <li>    <p>The chapters on first-class modules, parsing with Menhir, and objects
and classes have been significantly revised from beta1. Our thanks to
Leo White for contributing significantly to the latter two chapters.</p>
  </li>
  <li>    <p>All the code snippets and terminal outputs are now mechanically generated.
The source code is as close to public domain as practical, at:
    <a href="https://github.com/realworldocaml/examples">https://github.com/realworldocaml/examples</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>    <p>The final version will have the installation chapter moved to be online
only, and we intend to publish updates there to elaborate on installation
and packaging mechanisms.</p>
  </li>
  <li>    <p>Exercises will be available after we go into production, and also only be
available online. We really like the collaborative spirit of the commenting
system, and will likely extend this to collecting exercises from our readers
on an ongoing basis.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>There&#8217;s been quite a bit of feedback and conversation about the book, so this
also seemed like a good point to checkpoint the process somewhat.</p>

<h2>Crowd sourcing community feedback</h2>

<p><a href="http://realworldocaml.org"><img align="right" src="http://anil.recoil.org/images/oreilly-cover.gif" style="padding-left:15px" /></a>
<em>Good</em>: The decision to crowdsource feedback has been exhausting but very
worthwhile, with over 2,200 <a href="http://github.com/ocamllabs/rwo-comments">comments</a> posted (and over 2,000
resolved by us too!).  O&#8217;Reilly has a similar platform called
<a href="http://atlas.labs.oreilly.com">Atlas</a> that wasn&#8217;t quite ready when we started
our book, but I&#8217;d highly encourage new authors to go down this route and not
stick with a traditional editorial scheme.</p>

    <hr />    <div class="entry">      <div class="content">        <div>          <p>When I finished writing my PhD, I swore (as most recent graduates do) to never
write a thesis again.  Instead, life would be a series of pleasantly short
papers, interspersed with the occasional journal article, and lots of
not-writing-huge-book-activity in general.</p>

<p><a href="http://realworldocaml.org"><img align="right" src="http://anil.recoil.org/images/oreilly-cover.gif" style="padding-left:15px" /></a>
Then <a href="http://cufp.org/conference/2011">CUFP 2011</a> happened, and I find myself
in a bar in Tokyo with <a href="https://twitter.com/yminsky">Yaron Minsky</a> and <a href="http://monkey.org/~marius">Marius Eriksen</a>, and a dangerous bet ensued.
A few short weeks after that, and Yaron and I are chatting with <a href="https://plus.google.com/111219778721183890368">Jason Hickey</a> in California about
writing a book about the language we love.  I&#8217;m still telling myself that this will never actually happen,
but then everyone&#8217;s favourite Californirishman <a href="http://www.serpentine.com/blog/">Bryan O&#8217;Sullivan</a> puts us in touch with O&#8217;Reilly,
who published his excellent <a href="http://realworldhaskell.org">Haskell</a> tome.</p>

<p>O&#8217;Reilly arranged everything incredibly fast, with our editor <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/andyo">Andy Oram</a> driving us through the process.  We
decided early on that we wanted to write a book that had opinions based our
personal experience: about how OCaml code should be written, about the standard
library involved, and generally making functional programming more accessible.
Along the way, we&#8217;ve been working incredibly hard on the underlying software
platform too, with <a href="http://ocaml.janestreet.com">Jane Street</a>, <a href="http://ocamlpro.com">OCamlPro</a> and my own
group <a href="http://ocaml.io">OCaml Labs</a> working together on all the pieces.  There&#8217;s
still a lot of work left to do, of course, but we&#8217;re right on track to get
all this released very soon now.</p>

<p>So, without further ado, I was very pleased to send this e-mail this morning.
(and once again reaffirm my committment to never writing another book ever
again.  Until next time!)</p>

<blockquote>  <p>Yaron Minsky, Jason Hickey and I are pleased to announce the beta release of
our forthcoming O&#8217;Reilly book, called &#8220;Real World OCaml&#8221;, available online at
<a href="http://realworldocaml.org">http://realworldocaml.org</a></p>

  <p>The book is split into three parts: language concepts, tools and techniques,
and understanding the runtime.  As promised last year, we are making a public
beta available for community review and to help us hunt down inaccuracies &#8230;</p></blockquote>

<h3>Making mockups</h3>

<p>Over the last few months, I&#8217;ve been working on various aspects of the <a href="http://ocaml.org">OCaml.org</a> design project.  This covers things like the design, information architecture and how to incorporate new functionality.  One of the methods for thinking through these was to put together a bunch of wireframes using <a href="http://www.balsamiq.com">Balsamiq</a> and use these to express (and generate) ideas as well as get feedback quickly.</p>

<p>If you haven&#8217;t used wireframes before, think of them as a slightly more advanced form of sketching things out on a whiteboard.  The best aspect is that it&#8217;s far quicker, easier and <em>cheaper</em> to iterate using wireframes than on an actual website.  As you&#8217;ll see below, you can also convey a lot of information about how a site might work by showing people a clickable demo.</p>

<p>I want to make this work public and I thought the best way would be to show you some screencasts of how the upcoming <a href="http://ocaml.org">OCaml.org</a> website might work and also make the demo available to all of you.  The three videos below cover three aspects of the site and I&#8217;d encourage you to go through them in order (about 16 minutes in total).  Apologies if my screen isn&#8217;t particularly clear in the videos but you can visit the demo for yourself and see things in more detail (link and info on feedback at the end of this post).</p>

<h3>Video walkthroughs</h3>

<p>For those who&#8217;d like to watch the videos back-to-back and scaled to fit your browser window, you can <a href="http://vimeo.com/couchmode/album/2301640">view the Vimeo album in &#8216;couchmode&#8217;</a>. Otherwise, individual videos are embedded below (total time 16m17s).</p>

    <hr />    <div class="entry">      <div class="content">        <div>          <p>I&#8217;m very excited to announce <em><a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/projects/ocamllabs">OCaml Labs</a></em>, the latest project to hit the Cambridge Computer Lab. As anyone that hangs out near me probably realises, I very much enjoy functional programming.
My weapon of choice tends to be <a href="http://www.ocaml-lang.org">OCaml</a>, as it condenses <a href="http://events.inf.ed.ac.uk/Milner2012/X_Leroy-html5-mp4.html">decades of research</a> into a
pragmatic blend of functional, imperative and object-oriented programming styles.
What&#8217;s perhaps less well known are the steady <a href="http://www.ocaml-lang.org/companies.html">inroads</a> that OCaml has been making into mission-critical areas of industry.
At <a href="http://ocaml.janestreet.com">Jane Street</a>, billions of dollars of transactions are routed through a huge ML code-base that is designed to catch bugs <a href="http://vimeo.com/14313378">at compile-time</a>.
At <a href="http://github.com/xen-org/xen-api">Citrix</a>, the Xen management toolstack that powers <a href="http://blogs.citrix.com/2012/10/09/one-in-a-million/">millions</a> of hosts in the cloud is <a href="http://anil.recoil.org/papers/2010-icfp-xen.pdf">largely written in OCaml</a>.
Facebook does sophisticated <a href="https://github.com/facebook/pfff/wiki/Main">static analysis</a> using OCaml over their vast PHP codebase to close security holes.</p>

<p>The OCaml community is small but dedicated, but there is always more to do to
improve the language and ecosystem. So, thanks to a generous platform grant
from <a href="http://ocaml.janestreet.com">Jane Street</a>, we are launching a program to
help with the open-source development of OCaml from Cambridge.</p>

<p>The <em><a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/projects/ocamllabs/">OCaml Labs</a></em> are based in the <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk">Cambridge Computer Lab</a> and led my myself, <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~am21/">Alan Mycroft</a> and <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~iml1/">Ian Leslie</a>.  We&#8217;re closely affiliated with other <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/projects/ocamllabs/collaboration.html">groups</a>, and will be:</p>

<ul>  <li>    <p>developing the OCaml Platform, which will bundle the official OCaml compiler from INRIA with a tested set of community libraries that refreshed every six months. </p>
  </li>
  <li>    <p>working with the core OCaml team at INRIA&#8217;s <a href="http://gallium.inria.fr/">Gallium</a> group on the compiler, and with commercial partners like <a href="http://ocamlpro.com">OCamlPro</a> on tool development. OCamlPro are making some very impressive progress already with the <a href="http://opam.ocamlpro.com">OPAM</a> packge manager and <a href="http://www.typerex.org">TypeRex</a> IDE helper.</p>
  </li>
  <li>    <p>supporting the online presence with more teaching material and content.  Yaron, Jason and I are working hard on a <a href="http://realworldocaml.org">new book</a> that will be published next year, and the OCaml Web team (led by <a href="http://ashishagarwal.org">Ashish</a> and <a href="https://plus.google.com/109604597514379193052/posts">Christophe</a>) have made great progress on a <a href="http://www.ocaml-lang.org">brand new website</a> that we will move to the <code>oc&#8230;</code></p></li></ul>
